  # Tunnel authentication configuration. Choose ONE of these three methods:
  auth:
    # Option 1: Use an API token and account ID to create and manage tunnel via Cloudflare API
    # - set apiToken to your Cloudflare API token
    # - set accountId to your Cloudflare account ID
    # - leave tunnelToken and credentialsFile empty
    apiToken: ""
    accountId: ""
    
    # Option 2: Use a tunnel token (connector) for an existing tunnel
    # - set tunnelToken to your tunnel token
    # - leave apiToken, accountId and credentialsFile empty
    tunnelToken: ""
    
    # Option 3: Use credentials.json for an existing tunnel
    # - set credentialsFile to your complete b64-encoded credentials.json content
    # - leave apiToken and tunnelToken empty
    credentialsFile: ""

    # Optional: Override the automatically determined authentication method
    # If not set, the method will be determined based on which credentials are provided
    # Valid values: api, token, credentials

  # (Optional) Enable WARP routing for TCP

  # (Optional) Define ingress rules for the tunnel. See

  ingress: []
    # The first rule proxies traffic to the httpbin sample service named web-server at port 80
    # - hostname: tunnel.example.com
    #   service: http://web-service:80
    # This rule sends traffic to the built-in hello-world HTTP server. This can help debug connectivity
    # issues. If hello.example.com resolves and tunnel.example.com does not, then the problem is
    # in the connection from cloudflared to your local service, not from the internet to cloudflared.
    # - hostname: hello.example.com
    #   service: hello_world
